The goal of this stage of the process is to uncover important factors that could influence the outcome of the project. Neglecting this step can mean that a great deal of effort is put into producing the right answers to the wrong questions."

On the other hand certain companies have a reputation of having a very devouted fanbase that like any game they put out regardless of the games flaws.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is an important problem as some games can contain egregious 'Micro-transactions' which, while very profitable for the company, are often implemented in a way that has a negative impact on the base game. I am conducting this research to try and find if companies that are notorious for implementing systems like these have a lower user review score for their games, even for their games that dont implement these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial way im going to determine this is to compare the average user score to the average score of the official reviewers. Afterwards,for each game for a specific publisher a user has reviewed, i will compare their score to the average user score for that game. I will use this data to determine whether they tend to give lower or higher scores based on the publisher.\n",

    "This will not be a way of finding out whether a game will suceed or not, but stakeholders frequently look at metacritic scores of a companys games as a way of deciding whether they want to invest or not.\n",
