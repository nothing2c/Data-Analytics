The goal of this stage of the process is to uncover important factors that could influence the outcome of the project. Neglecting this step can mean that a great deal of effort is put into producing the right answers to the wrong questions."

On the other hand certain companies have a reputation of having a very devouted fanbase that like any game they put out regardless of the games flaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some relevant issues that might affect statistics are whether the company is notorious for releasing games with undesirable features such as DRM or 'Loot Boxes'\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important problem as some games can contain egregious 'Micro-transactions' which, while very profitable for the company, are often implemented in a way that has a negative impact on the base game. I am conducting this research to try and find if companies that are notorious for implementing systems like these have a lower user review score for their games, even for their games that dont implement these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial way im going to determine this is to compare the average user score to the average score of the official reviewers. Afterwards,for each game for a specific publisher a user has reviewed, i will compare their score to the average user score for that game. I will use this data to determine whether they tend to give lower or higher scores based on the publisher.\n",

    "A book that has done research on this topic before is eludamos: Journal for Computer Game Culture. In this book, there is a study comparing games metacritic score to the number of sales they achieved. While this doesnt directly assist my research, its conclusion was that games with a higher score generally sold better shows that it is in a companys best interest to atain a high metascore for their games. So it is in a companys best interest to try and stay on the good side of customers too try and maintain a high metascore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some companies that have a bad reputation are EA, Activision and Take-Two interactive (owns 2K and RockstarNorth) have a bad relationship with their customers. These companies also partake in some practices that can skew my data. For example, Activisions subsidiaries Infinity Ward and Treyarch have a history of releasing their games normally, wait until all the reviews have come in, and then implement consumer unfreindly features such as loot boxes. With practices like this, there is a possibility that some people have grown to dislike the the company that create or publish the game and this may influence their review of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how a publisher behind a game can leave a negative impact is for the release trailer for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice at E3 2018. The developer, From Software have a good reputation for creating good games that dont try to exploit the consumer. When their logo appeared in the trailer, there was audible excitement from the crowd. However, when the publisher appeared on the screen showed afterwards, all the cheering stopped and turned to concern. Many people who would have initially bought this game just because From Software devolped it were now on the fence just bucause Activision published it.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side of the spectrum is Nintendo who have a reputation of having a very dedicated fanbase. For example, when Gamefreak, a subsiduary of Nintendo, release a new Pokemon game, they always release two versions of the game with minimal differences between them. Some people see this as an exploitive practice to make more money, but for some extreme fans they see this as just more Pokemon games to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "With examples like these, i wish to see if the reputation these companies have accrued have affected the metacritic score for their games in any significant way."
